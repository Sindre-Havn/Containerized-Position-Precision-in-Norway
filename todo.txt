Improve function names:
- The function getDayNumber is a missleading name since it calls on sortData and
  does so much more than it should gven its name. Should only get day.

Improve documentation:
- Found out the folder backend/unzipped/ should contain the proper .gz ephemeris unzipped.
- Following the README for downloading ephemeris data using dowloadfile.py did not work.
  When downloadfile.py was ran, only got the html for the loggin page as return, not the .rnx.gz files.
  It may be needed to logg permanently in (stay signed in) on earthdata. If that is the case it should be better documented.
  Need to improve documentation and troubleshoot downloadfile.py
  The loggin-page respons from earthdata can be seen in delete_this__is_bad_respons_html_from_dowloadfile.html

Make config file for storing things like angle_resolution for skyplots.
It is currently hardcoded to 1 in computebaner.py, in line 
 "for i in range(0,360,1):"

Remove camel case and use snakecase as standard.

Remove unused/commented out code and modules.

Fix or remove tests.

This repo is written in a mix of Norwegian and English language.
Will standardise English in the repo, and reserve Norwegian
for the API's that needs it.

Currently the whole module (as seen in benchmarking.pdf) takes over 25 min to run on average....
If production code is written in python it should at least be optimized.
Can we get bellow 5 min? o_O

The benchmarking was performed with default settings. The paremeters was:
 Vegsytemsreferanse = EV136
 Distance = 1000
 GNSS Names = [GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, Beidou, QZSS]
 Start Point (E,N) = 124657.85,6957624.16
 End Point (E,N)   = 193510.27,6896504.01
 Time of Day (UTC) = 06/26/2025, (Clock varying from 12-16)
 Elevation Angle = 10 degree
 Time epoch = 1 h
 Calculation Interval = every 30 min
 Search Satellites at Point Nr = 0

Comment about "Search Satellites at Point Nr:" on website:
When inserting "Time Epoch = 10h" and "Calculation Interval = 10 min"
into the sliding bars on the website, only 21 epoch show on the graphs,
even though 61 epochs are expected. This should be communicated to the user.

Improve file names:
- downloadfile.py ==> dowload_ephemeris.py
