New feature
  concurrency.py - conurrent prossesing for finding DOP Values and satellite count at point.


find_dop_on_point() - change input parameters. Concurrent processing using multiprocessing.pool demands args to be picklable.
                      Main difference was not passing "src" as an arg, but extracting necessary components and pass
                      those as args. This change also affected functions called by find_dop_on_point().
